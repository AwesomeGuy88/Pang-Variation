Features
 - Object Oriented C++
 - Beginner level game programming
 - Small scale project with 14 cpp files
 - Still has many bugs
 
How to play?
Copy of popular game "Pang". use Up, Down, Left and Right arrow keys
to control a paddle to hit the ball against an AI. Exit to return
back to the screen. 


Developer Tools
- Windows OS
- Visual Studio 2017
- SFML 2.4.2
- beepbox.co
- Gimp 2


Setup Instructions for the Project
1) Install Visual Studio 2017 
2) Create a new Visual Studio Project
3) Clone source code into into your project
4) Set up SFML 2.4.2 (Complicated 30min)
Instructions are at https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.4/start-vc.php
5) Add all source to your visual studio project directory and
to the project solution
6) Build for both Debug and Release modes to check if working
*You may have issues with detecting the precompiled header. Set it
to create a new precompiled header rather than use the existing one.


Link for executable
As the setup can be quite complicated, I've also included a link
to the executable for anyone that wants to try it out.

How I developed this?
The steps and resources I've used are listed.
1) Reinforcing my understanding of C++
 - Reading C++ For Dummies by Stepen R Davis
 - Creating simple programs using concepts from textbook
2) Following C++ tutorial
http://www.gamefromscratch.com/page/Game-From-Scratch-CPP-Edition-The-Introduction.aspx
 - Implementation of OOP, memory management, Service Locator Pattern
 - Using Visual Studio capabilities - Debug/Release, external libraries
 - Manipulating images through Gimp 2 and image licensing
3) Adding my own personal touch
 - Learned how to use Gimp 2 and image licensing
 - Created my own logo
 - Altering images in the game
 - Additions to splash screen code
 
 
Motivation?
I've learned programming through my Engineering degree but am also
a big fan of reading novels on http://www.wuxiaworld.com/. I really want
to bring to life my experience of reading novels through a 2d retro
game but still need more skills to be able to do this. I started this
project in hopes of learning some of those skills before I move on 
to a larger project.
